   "Watisfuturenet2": "FutureNet.club is a new revolutionary social multimedia platform where, unlike the known platforms, you get paid for your activities or recruit new members. The idea has been developed since 2012 and has been online since 2014. Whether you post messages, chat, share movies or liked, all of these activities will immediately provide you with money. This is admittedly small income. If you want to earn the big money, you can go to one or more of their earnings models. FutureNet is now active in more than 180 countries, has over 4000000 members and is growing with 5000 per day! Make a <b>free account</b> via this website under one of the promoted Ref-links of FutureNet Belgium and take a look at the club what it has to offer you.",

  "modpsub2": "De matrix van FutureNet is het krachtigste verdienmodel",
  "modptext2": "<b>Hoe krijg ik een matrixpositie?</b><br><ul><li>Koop jij bij FutureNet mediapunten waarmee je gebruikt kunt maken van hun online diensten, products of gamingtools, dan krijg je in ruil daarvoor een matrixpositie. U kunt deze mediapunten verkrijgen door geld te storten of van uw online verdiensten in de AdPro.</li><li>Ben je actief in de AdPro of in het futuronetwork dan krijg je automatisch een matrixpostitie van FutureNet als je later geld gaat opnemen van jouw verdiensten.</li></ul><br><b>Hoeveel matrices zijn er?</b><ul><li>Er zijn 6 matrices waarin je actief kunt zijn. Iedere matrix is uniek. Eenmaal iemand een positie heeft ingenomen is deze onomkeerbaar.</li><li>De laagste matrix begint vanaf $10, volgende naar $25 BASIC, $50 GOLD, $100 EXCLUSIVE, $500 SAPPHIRE en $1000 ROYAL. U kunt sparen en uw matrix upgraden of u kunt ze allemaal in één keer opwaarderen. Dan betaal je $1685.</li></ul><br><b>Hoe kan ik geld verdienen met de matrix?</b><ul><li>Voor iedereen die door jou (referals) of door één van jouw teamleden(personal referals) later in jouw matrix terecht zal komen, krijg jij van FutureNet 5% van de aankoopwaarde van de matrix waarin je actief bent. Ook is het mogelijk dat je af en toe iemand in jouw matrix ontvangt van upliners. Dit noemen we een spillover.</li></ul>",
  "modptext2-1": "<b>Hoeveel kan ik hiermee verdienen?</b><ul><li>Voor iedere persoon in jouw matrix ontvang je van FutureNet 5% van de aankoopwaarde van die matrix waarin je actief bent. Bijvoorbeeld: een matrix van $50 brengt je telkens $2.5 op. Er zijn 88000??? plaatsen per matrix aan 5%. Bekijk onderstaande tabel voor wat jouw winsten kunnen zijn per matrixpositie.</li></ul>",
  "modptext2-2": "<b>Het verhaal wordt nog interessanter!!!</b><br>Heb je members in je matrix die jijzelf hebt ingeschreven (frontliner) dan krijgen ze een groen bolletje. Telkens deze mensen geld verdienen, krijg jij van futurenet nogmaals 50% bonus bovenop de verdiensten die je al ontving van de nieuwe vriend in jou matrix. Dit noemt men matchingbonus.<br>Het is dus belangrijk dat de eerste 3 members in jouw eerste lijn van de matrix, frontliners zijn (aangeduidt met het groen icoon)! Vandaar dat de mensen die kennis hebben van matrixen, de eerste 3 posities boven hen zelf kopen. Als er op deze manier iemand in jouw matrix belandt, dan ontvang je telkens 2 keer 5% plus 2.5% matchingbonus. Bijvoorbeeld matrix $10 dollar brengt je dan telkens $1.25dollar op!<br><br><b>Waarom snel upgraden naar een hogere matrixpositie?</b><br>Ieder teammember dat een matrixupgrade doet waarin jij niet actief bent, springt over jou heen en komt nooit meer in jouw matrix. De kans bestaat erin dat deze persoon op jou en heel je team dan geld gaat verdienen. Dus denk je een teammember te hebben die hoger upgrade dan jou, zorg dan dat je hem of haar voorblijft!!!<br><br>Wenst u meer uitleg of hulp?
