You can save and upgrade your matrix or you can top them up all at once. Then you pay $1685.</li></ul><br><b>How can I make money with the matrix?</b><ul><li>For everyone that you (personal referrals) or by one of your team members (referrals) will end up in your matrix later on. If you are active in FutureNet, you will receive 5% of the purchase value of the matrix in which you are active.

Every time these people make money in the matrix, you get a 5% bonus from FutureNet on top of the earnings you already received from the new friend in your matrix. This is called matching bonus.<br>It is therefore important that the first 3 members in your first line of the matrix are frontliners (indicated by the green dot)! That is why people who have knowledge of matrices, buy the first 3 positions above them. If someone ends up in your matrix in this way, you will receive 2 times 5% plus 2.5% matching bonus each time. For example, matrix $ 10 dollars will bring you $ 1.25dollar each time! <br><br><b> Why quickly upgrade to a higher matrix position?</b><br>Every team member that does a matrix upgrade in which you are not active jumps over you and never comes into your matrix again.

  "Verklaartext2": "<ul><li><b>Upgrade in the matrix</b>:<br>There are 6 matrices. You start on the $ 10 matrix.

Suppose you make a fourth person, then it comes to level 2 (assuming your level 1 is full). At level 2 there can therefore be 9 people (each person of level 1 may have 3 people above them, so 3x3 = 9). At level 3, still viewed from your point of view, 27 people can stand. At level 4 there can then be 81 and at level 5 there can be 243. The diagram below clarifies this.</li></ul>",
  "Verklaartext4": "       Sometimes you can see green balls standing in front of people. Those green balls stand for the people that you have applied yourself and therefore automatically joined into your team. At what position do they then stand? That is what FutureNet chooses according to this principle: He will look at the first free place in your team. For example, suppose this is at level 2. Then he looks at <b>level 2</b> whether the first place is occupied by person 1 (from level 1). If this is taken, he looks at person 2 (from level 1) whether the first place of level 2 has been taken. If this is also taken, then he looks at person 3 (from level 1) if the first place is occupied at level 2. If all these places are taken, he looks back at person 1 (at level 1) or his second place level 2, etc. The first free place will be the starting position of the new team member.",
  "Verklaartext5": "       How is it that sometimes there are no green balls in certain people? This is because the FutureNet system, as explained above, will search for the first free place. Coincidentally, it could be that this falls on a person in your team and then that place is taken. This is certainly not bad because you can earn on him/her because they joined your team. But because you did not apply yourself, you will not be entitled to the matching bonus within the Power Matrix.",

You can upgrade your status position to status 5. This costs you $ 16 / month, but you can receive 8% commission on level 1, on level 2 4% and on the next 3 levels 1%.
