  "advertentie": "The advertising platform or 'AdPro' is the ideal starting model. You can start with only 10 dollars. You buy ad-packs from 10 or 50 dollars and all you have to do is click 10 random ads a day. This takes about 10 minutes. After a year, your money has tripled. If you can persuade your friends to participate, the income can start to rise enormously. With the right people in your team you will quickly earn more than a monthly wage with Futurenet.

  "matrix": "Everyone who's active within Futurenet will automatically get positions in the matrix. One other option is to buy positions in order to earn money faster. You earn by people who come under you in the matrix. This earning model is about a slightly longer term, but later on the big money will be earned. Read more...",

Het enige wat u moet doen is minstens één adpack kopen en elke dag tien advertenties bekijken (dit duurt in totaal nog geen 10 minuten). Elk half uur zal het verdiende bedrag bij op uw account verschijnen. Wanneer u voldoende geld op deze account hebt, koop je een adpack bij of schrijf je het geld over naar je rekening. Wil je meer verdienen, dan heb je twee mogelijkheden: Je koopt meer adpacks of je zoekt vrienden die ook willen starten. Op de mensen die onder jou ingeschreven zijn verdien je (telkens ze een adpack kopen) nog extra! Op deze manier kan je business zeer snel groeien! ",

Through improvisation, the clowns try to evoke this environment again within the four walls of a hospital room and in this way provide some distraction. For the clowns each child is unique and the clown game is therefore fully attuned to the character and the fantasy world of the child. Thanks to their years of experience, our clowns know the emotional world of a child like no other. They are therefore the right people to give some comfort, but especially fun and relaxation to the children. Our clowns now visit 30 hospitals in both parts of the country. In these hospitals they can be found weekly so that they can reach as many children as possible. Hospitals do not have to pay for this free service but the clowns who do this beautiful job are professional people and are reimbursed for this.",
