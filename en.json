  "advertentie": "The advertising platform or 'AdPro' is the <b>ideal starting model</b>. You buy AdPacks of 10 or 50 dollars and all you have to do is click 10 random ads a day. This takes about 5 to 10 minutes. With the AdPro you have the opportunity to triple your money on an annual basis. If you can persuade your friends to participate, the income can start to rise enormously. With the right people in your team you will quickly earn more than a monthly wage with Futurenet. <br>Read more...",
  "matrix": "Everyone who's active within Futurenet will automatically get positions in the matrix. One other option is to buy positions in order to earn money faster. You earn by people who come under you in the matrix. This earning model is about a slightly longer term, but later on the big money will be earned. <br>Read more...",

  "modptext1": "Every day millions of dollars circulate in online advertising. Companies want to be seen and for that you will get money from FutureNet. <br> <b> How does the AdPro work? What are my daily activities and can I earn with this? </b> <br> With every purchase of 50 $ advertising space (called AdPacks) you get the opportunity at FutureNet : <br> * 800 times to advertise your business or products. This is not a must, you can also save your views. <br> * earn back 60 $ (120%). <br>All you need to do is watch around 10 days a day for about 130 days, regardless of how many AdPacks you have. The time you spend on this on a daily basis is about 5 to 10 minutes. The earned amount will appear on your account every half an hour. When you have enough money on this account, you buy an adpack or transfer the money to your account. If you still forget to watch a day, you will take a day longer to generate 60 $.",
  "modptext1-1": "TABLE POSSIBLE MERITS <br><br> If you want to earn more, you have two options: You buy more adpacks or you are looking for friends who also want to start. On the people who are registered under you you earn (each time they buy an AdPack) extra! This way your business can grow very quickly! ",
  "modptext1-2": "BUSINESS TABEL <br><br> If an investment of 50 $ seems too much to start, you can still get started with 10 $ AdPacks. Note: These take an average of 30 days longer to generate 120%. <br> <b>Attention!</b> Regulations of FutureNet clearly show that you only have 1 AdPro account per household / IP address!",

Through improvisation, the clowns try to evoke this environment again within the four walls of a hospital room and in this way provide some distraction. For the clowns each child is unique and the clown game is therefore fully attuned to the character and the fantasy world of the child. Thanks to their years of experience, our clowns know the emotional world of a child like no other. They are therefore the right people to give some comfort, but especially fun and relaxation to the children. Our clowns now visit 30 hospitals in both parts of the country. In these hospitals they can be found weekly so that they can reach as many children as possible. Hospitals do not have to pay for this free service but the clowns who do this beautiful job are professional people and are reimbursed for this.",
